I've always felt that League of Legends was a very balanced game, but there are still a lot of champions with little to no counterplay. Also, the reliance on a team of random people often creates a stressful experience that makes the player feel helpless. So I'm trying to create a healthier, more dueling-oriented experience. The ultimate goal is a game where the winner earned his win without any tricks; just pure mechanics.

It will be developed at a rather slow pace while I'm learning how to build an engine.
